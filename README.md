AI Assistant:
 - Gemini 2.5 Pro - Base project generation, reasoning and coding
 - Claude Sonnet 4 - reasoning and coding
 - Chatgpt 4 & 5 - Debugging 
 - Qwen3-Coder-30B-A3B-Instruct.f16 and qwen2.5-coder:32b-instruct-fp16 (Local) - Evaluation and comparison only

Background: 
 - Zero knowledge of React Native or React
 - Less than 1 year experience of flutter mobile app development
 - Angular and AngularJs 7 years+ experience
 - JAVA 15 years+ experience

Difficulty faced:
 - With specific requirement like integrate expo with certain kind of UI libraries including React Native Paper,  GlueStack ,  React Native Elements,UI Kitten, Claude, Chatgpt and Qwen3 and qwen2.5 are unable to generated a integrated base project. Only Gemini 2.5 Pro can generate a base project by high level requirement like expo with material UI and React Native Paper is used. 
 -   When integrating Tensorflow lite to React Native Expo, Gemini 2.5 Pro and Chatgpt unable to figure out the @tensorflow/tfjs-react-native is not compatible to latest Expo. finally find out that npm install @tensorflow/tfjs-react-native --legacy-peer-deps should workaround in Stack overflow.


Impression:
Gemini 2.5 Pro and Claude Sonnet 4  is extremely powerful, just 2 prompts can generate a workable react native app with decent UI and feature can be easily added by additional prompt in minutes which may take weeks for a developers to complete.

ChatGPT is sometime better than Stack overflow when trouble shooting.
